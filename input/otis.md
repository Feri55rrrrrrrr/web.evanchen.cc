OTIS is an olympiad training program
for contestants who can write proofs and qualify for national olympiad
(e.g. consistently 10+ on AIME for the USA).
Students at other levels may be interested in
[my list of mentors and programs](mentors.html).

# {{ hl("excerpts", "The OTIS Excerpts") }}

Around the start of 2019, I posted publicly a
[collection of 192 problems and solutions](excerpts.html)
based on materials for OTIS.
This mini-book was named _The OTIS Excerpts_.
It is designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

# {{ hl("apply", "Application &mdash; Year VIII") }}

The regular deadline for 2022-2023 was August 1.
Late applications are now open, and will remain open until April 15.

See the instructions for details about late application.

- [Submission URL for fall 2022](https://forms.gle/16Fp6LVeB1Zhsrgz5)

## {{ hl("prereq", "Who can apply") }}

OTIS is open to anyone, including international students from all countries.
Students from minorities and underrepresented groups are especially encouraged
to apply. (I promise I don't bite.)
Full financial aid is available for all applications
(even late) and admissions is need-blind.

Admissions are only done to ensure students have sufficient mathematical
background and writing ability (due to sheer number of students,
there is no "grading"), understand English,
and are able to learn new material from Evan-style writing.
In particular, **admissions is not a merit-based competition**.
I like the [FAQ from Euler Circle](https://eulercircle.com/faq/),
which I've adapted for OTIS:

> The traditional way admissions are competitive is
> there are N applicants and M ≪ N spaces available.
> That is **not** the case for OTIS, where M > N at present.
> We dislike the idea of depriving students of an education;
> we will certainly not take any pride in doing so,
> and will never release statistics.
