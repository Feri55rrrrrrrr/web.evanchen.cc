The **OTIS Mock AIME** is an annual 3-hour exam consisting of 15 problems
whose answers are integers between $0$ and $999$.
As the name suggests, it is yet another unofficial paper intended to emulate the
[American Invitational Mathematics Exam][aime].

The defining characteristic of the OTIS Mock AIME is that all the problems
are composed by students from the [OTIS program](otis.html).
That is, Evan runs this annual exam as a way to give his students
a chance to try their hand at problem composition.
