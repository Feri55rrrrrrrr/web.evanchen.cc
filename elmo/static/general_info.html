The <b>ELSMO</b> is a new recent addition to the ELMO given to the misguided souls who unfortunately pronounce MOP as "MOSP", with an additional "S".
The ELSMO contestants are given three additional problems each day, which are usually ignored by most contestants.
The name and appearance of the ELSMO also differ from the corresponding ELMO.
